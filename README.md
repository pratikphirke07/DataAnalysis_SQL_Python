## DataAnalysis_SQL_Python
I embarked on this project to delve into the world of data analysis using SQL and showcase my skills in exploring and extracting valuable insights from complex datasets. The European Soccer Database, with its rich and comprehensive collection of soccer-related data, provided the perfect opportunity to apply SQL, Python, and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This project allowed me to gain practical experience in data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis, leveraging both SQL and Python's powerful tools for a thorough exploration of the dataset.
